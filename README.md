# Hello, I'm Devesh! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Computer Science student** passionate about building software that makes the world a better place for everyone. My interests span software development, science, and creative hobbies like sketching, story-writing, poetry, and music.

### ðŸ”­ Current Projects
- **[Extrawrite]**: A note-taking and publishing platform rethinking how we organize and interact with digital notes. Inspired by the limitations of current tools, *Extrawrite* offers full customizability for note design, moving beyond markdown to HTML-based flexibility. ðŸš€

### ðŸ’¡ What I'm Learning
- **TypeScript**: Leveraging static typing for more robust JavaScript applications.
- **JavaScript Promises**: Enhancing asynchronous programming with promises.
- **Vim for VSCode**: Mastering the productivity boost of Vim keybindings inside VSCode.

### ðŸŒ± Philosophy
Iâ€™m always exploring ways to improve productivity without adding complexity. I believe in reducing the time spent "learning how to learn" â€” focusing on *getting things done*.

### ðŸŽ¨ Hobbies
- **Sketching**: I enjoy visual creativity, which also complements my passion for software design.
- **Poetry**: I believe wise words can inspire societal change, and I express this belief through my poems.
- **Music**: My constant companion during long coding and brainstorming sessions.
